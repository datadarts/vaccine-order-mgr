# Vaccine-order-mgr project

See explanation of this application in [this article](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vaccine-cold-chain/vaccine-cold-chain-main/solution/orderms/)

## Appsody pre-requisite

You need to install the appsody CLI for [your operating system.](https://appsody.dev/docs/installing/installing-appsody)

Then you need to add an appsody repository we have started to develop:

```shell
appsody repo add ibmcase https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/appsody-stacks/master/ibmcase-index.yaml
# Verify you have ibmcase stacks listed
appsody repo list
```

## Build and run
